 Image fix!!

Keep it clean!


## Installing NPMs

To make sure you have all the node modules, run the below command as sudo. 

	sudo npm upgrade


## Build Source 
	node Cleaner.js



## Debugging Source 
Right now the best way to debug is just use node inspector.

	sudo npm install -g node-inspector

> might have to type password:pencil

After it is installed use the bash script to fire that bad boy up and get busy. :-)
	
	./DEBUG.sh



This is just a first stab. The compile and copy work but minify does not yet. No time to finish it.


## Grunt
To ensure the source is updated, use the grunt file :-)
	
	grunt

Keep up posted. :-)
